### Problem Statement Title
App to calculate rooftop area and reflectance from satellite data and estimate saving in electrical units as cooling load decrease by increasing the roof top reflectance by painting it white.
### Problem Description	
As you will be aware that white roof can make a huge difference in your home temperature and energy savings by reducing the cooling load. Can we develop a app which can give/calculate the area and current reflectance of rooftop of the building based on geo-location and satellite imagery? And also estimate the saving in electrical units (based on change in reflectance) as cooling load decreases by increasing the roof top reflectance by painting it white.(Solar insolation based on time, day location and season should also be considered)
